step1:start
step2:declare the variables count
step3:assigning the value 1 into count (count=10)
step4:print count
step5:decrement the count value by 1(count=count-1) then go to step 6
step6:then check the condition count is greater than or equal to 1(count>=1) goto step7
step7:if the condition is true gotostep 8 otherwise if condition is false goto step9 
step8:print count
step9:stop
